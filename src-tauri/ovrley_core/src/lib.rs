//! Core rendering and encoding library for OVRLEY.
//!
//! This crate is the Rust backend used by the Tauri shell. It owns the
//! production data path from frontend JSON payloads through activity trimming,
//! per-frame interpolation, Skia overlay rendering, ffmpeg encoding, progress
//! tracking, and debug artifact generation.
//!
//! Public modules are intentionally grouped by responsibility so the Tauri
//! command layer can stay thin while the testable business logic remains here.
